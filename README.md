# odin-recipes
First project yaaaay. This is from the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. I'm doing HTML rn, which means this project will be very simple. Just a basic recipe website comprising a main index page with some links to recipes. Will be revisiting this when I'm doing CSS, so for now, I'm just demonstrating my knowledge of elements and tags; the HTML boilerplate; text-based elements, lists, links, and images; and proper commit messages.
