# odin-recipes
First project yaaaay ꉂ(˵˃ ᗜ ˂˵)
This is from the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. I'm doing HTML rn, which means this project will be very simple. Just a basic recipe website comprising a main index page with some links to recipes. Will be revisiting this when I'm doing CSS, so for now, I'm just demonstrating my knowledge of...
- Elements and tags;
- The HTML boilerplate;
- Text-based elements, lists, links, and images; and
- Proper commit messages.
