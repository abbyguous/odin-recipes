# odin-recipes
First project yaaay ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و ♡

This is from the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. I'm doing HTML rn, which means this project will be very simple. Just a basic recipe website comprising a main index page with some links to recipes. Will be revisiting this when I'm doing CSS, so for now, I'm just demonstrating my knowledge of...
- Elements and tags;
- The HTML boilerplate;
- Text-based elements, lists, links, and images; and
- Proper commit messages.

All recipes and recipe images by me.

Retro:
- Scope creep is real, as they say.
- After a 4-month hiatus, I've finally finished it. Commits were messy asf because I kept jumping around, thinking of things to change here and there. For example, I realized that real chimichurri doesn't actually use cilantro, so I had to change the metadata and URLs to reflect the recipe name change. All within the commit "Finish tofu," which purportedly contains only work on the recipe page itself. But anyway, this is just a simple HTML project. I'll probably get the hang of atomic commits as I learn to write more complex code.
